Xorg driver for jamstudio drawing tablets

This is an attempt to resurrect a driver for the [KB Gear JamStudio Tablet](http://amzn.to/1Wic4tQ), which originally made an appearance [in 2002](https://lwn.net/Articles/13740/). The driver has languished for four or five years with no modernization efforts.
